# LocalSend
LocalSend File for Arch Users


Listen the localsend Arch File is working properly but it may or maynot work on every desktop environment.I tested this on KDE it worked on KDE.Other Desktops try on your own and try to fix any issues


The Package is made because of my need of localsend. Thanks to the Developers of Localsend and other tools which helped in making this package
